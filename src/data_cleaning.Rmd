## R Markdown

```{r}
data = read.csv('marketing_campaign.csv', sep = '\t')  # load data
head(data)  # print first 5 rows of data
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
